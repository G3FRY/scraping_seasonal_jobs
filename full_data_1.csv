Bee handler, prior to checking colonies/hives will prepare supplement food source by mixing various food products for bees in a cement mixer.  Mixture is then placed on extra bee hive/box lids that are then stacked onto pallets for transporting to field locations of colonies of bees (apiary).  Once the bee handlers reach this location, they will remove the original lid and replace with lids that were prepared with supplemental feed.  Two to three nights later, the night crew will add syrup.  This is done by removing the top box, and locating the syrup reservoir.  Then syrup is added to the reservoir by hose until the reservoir is full.  This process is then repeated until all hives at this location are serviced.  Bee handler will then travel to designated sites of other locations where other colonies/hives are located and repeat the process.  Bee handler will load, by forklift, or by hand, hives/boxes to locations of customers to be used fo the pollination of agricultural crops.

Bee handler will return and remove from these same locations hives/boxes of bees when pollination is complete, and return hives/boxes to their permanent sites (apiary).  Bee handler will then return to such sites (apiary) to remove bee frames for honey collection by opening the lid, and removing frames to be transported to shop for extraction. During extraction, bee handler will place the frames of honey on an uncapping machine that removes the bees wax.
